# Brew & Sculpt Café Website Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **small business website** for Brew & Sculpt Café, a hybrid coffee shop and art/sculpture studio. The site demonstrates both **plain and styled HTML pages** with a minimal black-and-white line-art aesthetic.  

**Pages included:**
- `index.html` – Home  
- `about.html` – About the café and art services  
- `services.html` – Services offered (coffee, art classes, sculpture exhibitions)  
- `enquiry.html` – Enquiry form for visitors  
- `contact.html` – Contact information and Google Maps  

**Styled pages:** Each plain HTML page has a corresponding styled version (`-styled.html`) with inline CSS for a clean design.
